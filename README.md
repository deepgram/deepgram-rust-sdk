A Community Rust SDK for [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/). Start building with our powerful transcription & speech understanding API.

## SDK Documentation

This SDK implements the Deepgram API found at [https://developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com).

Documentation and examples can be found on our [Docs.rs page](https://docs.rs/deepgram/latest/deepgram/).

## Getting an API Key

🔑 To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).


## Current Status

This SDK is currently Community owned but is moving to a stable `1.0` version soon.

## Install

From within your Cargo project directory, run the following command:

```sh
cargo add deepgram
```

You will also probably need to install [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio):

```sh
cargo add tokio --features full
```
