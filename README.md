A Community Rust SDK for [Deepgram](https://www.deepgram.com/). Start building with our powerful transcription & speech understanding API.

## SDK Documentation

This SDK implements the Deepgram API found at [https://developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com).

Documentation and examples can be found on our [Docs.rs page](https://docs.rs/deepgram/latest/deepgram/).

## Quick Start

Check out the [examples folder](./examples/) for practical code examples showing how to use the SDK.

## Authentication

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

There are two ways to authenticate with the Deepgram API:

1.  **API Key**: This is the simplest method. You can get a free API key from the
    [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

    ```rust
    use deepgram::Deepgram;

    let dg = Deepgram::new("YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");
    ```

2.  **Temporary Tokens**: If you are building an application where you need to
    grant temporary access to the Deepgram API, you can use temporary tokens.
    This is useful for client-side applications where you don't want to expose
    your API key.

    You can create temporary tokens using the Deepgram API. Learn more about
    [token-based authentication](https://developers.deepgram.com/guides/fundamentals/token-based-authentication).

    ```rust
    use deepgram::Deepgram;

    let dg = Deepgram::with_temp_token("YOUR_TEMPORARY_TOKEN");
    ```

## Current Status

This SDK is currently Community owned but is moving to a stable `1.0` version soon.

## Install

From within your Cargo project directory, run the following command:

```sh
cargo add deepgram
```

You will also probably need to install [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio):

```sh
cargo add tokio --features full
```
